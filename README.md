# DevOps-Projects
In this repository I will upload my projects on DevOps and also Integration of DevOps technology with other technologies like Machine Learning, Git/Github, etc.<br>

Project-1 : Automated WebDevelopment Environment<br>
In this Project I have created an Automated Web Development Environment integrating Git/GitHub, Jenkins and Httpd WebServer in RHEL-8. In this Project the developer just need to Commit the code from his local repository, GitHub will automatically send the code to Jenkins using webhooks as soon as there will be any commit in GitHub repo, and Jenkins will then automatically launch the website into apache2 httpd server.<br>


Project-2 : Automated WebSite Deployement within Docker<br>
In this Project I have created an Automated Website Deployment inside a docker container. In this project I have used the techologies like Git/GitHub, Jenkins, and Docker Container for making an automated website deployment.<br>


Project-3 : Containerization Within Container<br>
In this Project I have used the concepts of docker to make Automation Project lanching docker-within-docker so that the Project can be easily shipped from one system to another without any problem. Docker Concepts are very useful for such projects when you need to send your project with complete environment of the project.<br>


Project-4 : CI/CD DevEnv/ProductionEnv Deployment<br>
In this project I have created Continous Deployment using Git, Jenkins and Docker but it more focused in automation of Developer Environment and Production Envirnoment Deployment. <br>


Project-5 : Automate CloudBuild Triggers using Terraform<br>
In this automation, the terraform script will automatically create a cloudbuild trigger with the defined configurations for the repository given and deploy it to GKE Cluster, defined in the terraform script.
